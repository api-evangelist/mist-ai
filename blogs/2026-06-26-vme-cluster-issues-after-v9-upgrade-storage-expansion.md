Hi all, I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction as we've run into some issues following an upgrade from HPE VM Essentials v8 to v9. Environment 3 x HPE ProLiant hosts running HPE VM Essentials Hypervisor (HVM) Single VME Manager instance HPE Alletra 6000 storage 2 x shared GFS2 datastores Prior to upgrading, I expanded both GFS2 datastores from 500 GB to 750 GB on the Alletra storage and performed the grow operation to make the additional capacity available within the cluster. Upgrade Process I then: Upgraded the VME Manager from v8 to v9 using the provided .deb package.
